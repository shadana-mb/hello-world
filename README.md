# About Me

Hi! I am Shadana. I'm 29 and I'm new to programming. 

## My Story

I always wanted to learn programming since my teenage years. I asked my dad to teach me the basics and he tricked me to first enroll in an ICDL course which was really boring. I already knew most of the stuff and it just worked for my dad because I never asked him again. After 16 years I'm back to what I always wanted. This time, I'm training myself thanks to the enormous online resources.
